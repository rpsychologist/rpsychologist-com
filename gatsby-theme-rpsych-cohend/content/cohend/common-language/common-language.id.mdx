With a Cohen's <em>d</em> of {props.cohend}, {props.U3} of the "{props.muOneLabel}" group will be above the mean of the "{props.muZeroLabel}" group (Cohen's U<sub>3</sub>), {props.propOverlap} of the two groups will overlap, and there is a {props.CL} chance that a person picked at random from the "{props.muOneLabel}" group will have a higher score than a person picked at random from the "{props.muZeroLabel}" group (probability of superiority). Moreover, in order to have one more favorable outcome in the "{props.muOneLabel}" group compared to the "{props.muZeroLabel}" group, we need to treat {props.NNT} people on average. This means that if there are 100 people in each group, and we assume that {props.CER} people have favorable outcomes in the "{props.muZeroLabel}" group, then {props.CER} + {props.NNTPerc} people in the "{props.muOneLabel}" group will have favorable outcomes.<sup>1</sup>

<Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
<sup>1</sup>The values are averages, and it is assumed that {props.CER} (CER) of the "{props.muZeroLabel}" group have "favorable outcomes," i.e., their outcomes are below some cut-off. Change this by pressing the settings symbol to the right of the slider. Go to the formula section for more information.
