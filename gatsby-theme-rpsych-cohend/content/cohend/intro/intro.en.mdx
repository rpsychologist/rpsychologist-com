The Cohen's *d* effect size is immensely popular in psychology.
However, its interpretation is not straightforward and researchers 
often use general guidelines, such as small (0.2), medium (0.5) and
large (0.8) when interpreting an effect. Moreover, in many cases it is
questionable whether the standardized mean difference is more
interpretable than the unstandardized mean difference.

In order to aid the interpretation of Cohen’s *d*, this
visualization offers these different representations of Cohen's *d*:
visual overlap, Cohen’s U<sub>3</sub>, the probability of superiority,
percentage of overlap, and the number needed to treat. It also lets you
change the standard deviation and displays the unstandardized difference.
