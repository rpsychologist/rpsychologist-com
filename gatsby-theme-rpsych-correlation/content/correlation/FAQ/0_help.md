## Load CSV files
You can load your own data from a CSV file. The CSV file must have this structure:
```
x,y
10.0, 11.0
12.0, 12.0
..., ...
```

The first row is the column names, where the first column is assumed to be the x variable and the second the y variable - all other columns are ignored.

### Your data is _not_ uploaded
